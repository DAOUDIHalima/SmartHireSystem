2. **Container Orchestration with Kubernetes**
   - Deploy microservices to a Kubernetes cluster.
   - Use Helm charts to manage Kubernetes applications.

3. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
   - Automate build, test, and deployment processes for each microservice.
   - Store Docker images in Docker Hub or GitHub Packages.
